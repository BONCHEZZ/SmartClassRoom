Class Track AI

Academix

Hackathon Presentation

Slide 1: Introduction

Good morning judges and mentors.

We are Academix, and today we are presenting an AI‑assisted smart attendance and class monitoring system designed to solve real problems in university learning environments.


Slide 2: Problem Statement

In many universities, attendance and class communication still rely on:

Manual signing sheets

Unverified attendance records

WhatsApp groups and class representatives


This leads to:

Inaccurate student attendance records

No tracking of lecturer attendance

Delayed communication

Students wasting time attending classes that don’t happen

Limited accountability for departments



Slide 3: Why This Is a Serious Problem

Students lose valuable learning time

Lecturers lack accountability

Departments cannot enforce policies

Attendance data is unreliable

Overall academic efficiency is reduced


This directly affects student satisfaction and academic performance.


Slide 4: Our Proposed Solution

We built an AI‑assisted smart attendance and class monitoring system that uses:

QR code attendance

Real‑time notifications

AI‑powered analytics


The system automates attendance, improves communication, and introduces accountability across students, lecturers, and departments.

Slide 5: System Users

The system has three main users:

1. Students – Check in via QR code and receive class updates


2. Lecturers – Manage classes and attendance


3. HOD/Admin – Monitor attendance and enforce accountability


Slide 6: Student Dashboard Features

QR code scanner for attendance

Real‑time notifications (class cancelled, delayed, room change)

Attendance history

Timetable view

AI insights:

Attendance trends

Absenteeism risk prediction


Slide 7: Lecturer Dashboard Features

Generate unique QR codes per class session

Mark lecturer arrival

View student attendance in real time

Send instant announcements

Lecturer attendance analytics


Slide 8: HOD / Admin Dashboard Features

Department‑wide attendance overview

Lecturer attendance tracking

Student attendance reports

AI alerts for:

Frequent lecturer lateness

Low attendance units

Classes likely to be cancelled


Exportable reports


Slide 9: How QR Code Attendance Works

1. Lecturer generates a QR code for a class session


2. Students scan the QR code to check in


3. Attendance is validated by time and session


4. Duplicate or late check‑ins are prevented



This removes manual signing and fraud.


Slide 10: Real‑Time Communication

The system automatically notifies students when:

A lecturer is late

A class is cancelled

Class details change


This prevents wasted time and confusion.

Slide 11: AI Component (Smart Analytics)

The AI analyzes attendance data to:

Predict student absenteeism risk

Detect frequent lecturer lateness

Identify classes likely to be cancelled

Generate smart departmental reports


This enables proactive decision‑making.

Slide 12: Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Backend: Node.js and Express

Database: MongoDB / Firebase

QR Codes: JavaScript‑based generator and scanner

Charts & Analytics: Chart.js


Slide 13: Live Demo

In this demo, we will show:

1. Student QR code attendance


2. Lecturer generating a QR code and sending updates


3. Admin dashboard with analytics and alerts


Slide 14: Impact of the System

Improved attendance accuracy

Better lecturer accountability

Reduced misinformation

Saved student time

Data‑driven departmental decisions


Slide 15: Scalability & Future Improvements

With more time, the system can be expanded to:

Mobile applications

Biometric verification

LMS integration

Advanced AI/ML models

Institution‑wide deployment


Slide 16: Conclusion

Our solution transforms attendance and class communication by:

Automating attendance

Enabling real‑time updates

Using AI for smarter insights


This creates a more transparent, efficient, and accountable academic environment.
