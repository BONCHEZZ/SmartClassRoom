You are an expert full-stack engineer and AI architect. Build a complete Smart Attendance System that replaces old-fashioned manual attendance sheets with QR-code–based check-ins.

System Name: SmartTrack QR
Your Tasks:

Design the full system architecture (frontend, backend, database, APIs, AI modules).

Build a working prototype showing the core workflow.

Ensure the system is simple, unique, and directly solves the real problem of unreliable attendance tracking.

Implement all core features with clean code examples, file structure, and explanations.

Focus on quality, scalability, and correctness.

✅ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
1. QR-Code Attendance

Generate a unique QR code for every scheduled class.

Students scan the QR code to mark attendance.

Authenticate students to prevent fake check-ins.

Store timestamps for arrival and class duration.

2. Real-Time Admin Dashboard

Show which students have attended in real time.

Show total classes vs attended classes.

Auto-calculate percentage attendance per student.

Display graphical insights.

3. Lecturer Portal

Create and schedule classes.

Automatically generate class QR codes.

View attendance analytics.

Notify students when:

A class is cancelled

A class is rescheduled

A student has missed a lecture

4. Student Portal

View upcoming and past classes.

Receive instant updates from lecturers.

View personal attendance percentage.

5. Notifications

Real-time alerts via email/SMS/in-app.

Admin gets notified when:

Class starts

Low attendance patterns detected

Students miss class excessively

6. AI Features 

Predict students at risk of low attendance.

Auto-flag suspicious attendance patterns.

Generate attendance summaries for admin.

7. Completeness & Quality Implementation

Provide:

File structure

API endpoints

Database schema (students, lectures, attendance logs, notifications)

QR generation logic

Real-time updates through WebSockets or Firebase

Example UI components

Security features (JWT, role-based access, anti-proxy QR validation)

✅ DELIVERABLES TO GENERATE

System architecture diagram

Tech stack recommendation Node,MongoDB,HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP,JavaScript etc.)

End-to-end workflow explanation

Prototype-level code for backend & frontend

Notification workflow

You are a senior full-stack engineer helping a hackathon team finalize an existing AI-assisted Smart Attendance & Class Monitoring System.
The system already exists. DO NOT rewrite or restructure the project.
Your task is to ANALYZE the current codebase and IMPLEMENT ONLY missing or incomplete core features while preserving all existing logic, UI, and file structure."


NSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do not delete or refactor working code

Do not change folder structure unless necessary

Extend existing components only

Add new files ONLY if a feature is completely missing

Mark all newly added code with comments

Assume limited hackathon time



 STEP 1: SYSTEM AUDIT

Analyze the existing system and identify which of the following core features are:

Fully implemented

Partially implemented

Missing


Clearly list the missing or broken features before implementing them.


 STEP 2: IMPLEMENT ONLY MISSING CORE FEATURES

 1. Lecturer Attendance Tracking

If missing:

Automatically mark lecturer attendance when a class session starts

Log arrival time and lateness

Store lecturer attendance per session

 2. Time-Bound QR Code Validation

If missing:

Ensure each QR code:

Is session-based

Expires after a defined time window

Prevents duplicate student scans


Validate QR data server-side


3. Real-Time Notifications

If missing or incomplete:

Notify students when:

Lecturer is late beyond threshold

Class is cancelled

Class starts late


Use existing real-time service if available (Socket.IO/Firebase)


4. Admin / HOD Visibility

If missing:

Add lecturer attendance logs to admin dashboard

Add student attendance summary per class

Add simple filters (date, course, lecturer)


 5. AI Insights (Rule-Based)

If missing:

Implement simple analytics:

Student absenteeism risk (Low/Medium/High)

Lecturer reliability score

Class cancellation likelihood


Use existing attendance data

Display insights using cards or charts



6. Data Integrity Checks

If missing:

Prevent:

Multiple check-ins for same session

Attendance without active session


Validate timestamps


 STEP 3: FRONTEND ENHANCEMENTS (MINIMAL)

Only if missing:

Add clear status indicators:

Class ongoing

Lecturer late

Class cancelled


Add notification badges

Add loading/error messages


 STEP 4: FINAL DEMO READINESS

Ensure:

No broken buttons or links

All dashboards are clickable

Sample data exists for demo

Console errors are fixed

System runs smoothly locally


FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED

List of added features

Code snippets showing changes

Brief explanation of AI logic

Demo instructions


Proceed carefully and incrementally.
Focus on functionality required for a hackathon demo.
Do not over-engineer.
Preserve existing system behavior.
